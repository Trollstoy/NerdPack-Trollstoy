# Starter Rotations for NerdPack

These rotations don't actually do anything. This is just a blank slate you can use to create your own.

For example to create your own routines called "MyCustomRoutines":

1. Rename the directory from NerdPack-Starter to MyCustomRoutines
2. Rename the NerdPack-Starter.toc to MyCustomRoutines.toc

```
git clone
```
